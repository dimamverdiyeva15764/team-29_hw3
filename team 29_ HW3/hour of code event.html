        The Hour of Code is a one-hour introduction to computer science that uses engaging tutorials to demonstrate that anybody can learn the fundamentals. This course helped us to teach the students the basics of computer science in a better way. We started the lesson by introducing ourselves and ADA university, then informed students about Hour of Code and Code.org. Before the class day, we(team members) assigned roles to each of us. Farid Baghirov was the tutor, Ali Garashli helped the students and tutor, and Dilara Imamverdiyeva helped the students and issued certificates to the class. Finally, Ali Ganizade shot videos and photos and also helped students. In addition, we used Classic Maze Puzzle in this class.
        Interestingly students had never worked with this website. Therefore, introducing them to this website was quite interesting. Despite that some students faced challenges, we assisted them, and students who were quick in learning helped their fellow students too. In the end, all the students finished the course and got rewarded with a certificate. This course helped them to gain skills of using engaging blocks and basic coding experiences.
