            and I graduated from Classical gymnasium № 160 and I am a freshman
            at ADA University. My major is Information System.Information technology 
            has always piqued my curiosity. I enjoy discovering new things about different applications,
            learning new computer features, and exploring different programs. 
            I especially enjoy using programs to filter specific moments from movies 
            to create unique videos. This is my ambition for the future. Research
             and develop all-possible programs.

            Hello! I am Farid Baghirov and I am 17 years old. 
            I graduated from School-Lyceum N6 named after Tofiq Ismayilov and
            I am a freshman at ADA University. My degree is Computer Engineering, 
            and the reasons behind this choice are quite interesting. 
            Since childhood I loved technologies and computers, 
            I took some courses when I was at school and 
            decided that I am mainly interested in this field.
            Although, I like business field too, 
            Computer Engineering was my main choice for bachelor’s degree. 
            I was awarded with 1st place due to my debating skills in ADA university 
            when I was studying in School-Lyceum № 6. 
            I was also rewarded with Best delegate and Outstanding diplomacy diplomas 
            in Dubai MUN and Istanbul MUN. Today I am looking forward 
            to the next challenges that I will face and be a successful person in my field.

            Hello, my name is Ali Garashli. I'm 18 years old, 
            and I graduated from School No. 53. Currently, I'm a BSCS 2026 student 
            at ADA University. I got into the IT field when I was still a kid, 
            amazed by how complex structures like a computer functioned flawlessly. 
            With the motivation to improve myself in this field, I applied to this university,
            and now as a student, I am looking forward to working together with my comrades 
            to achieve our goals and strive for a better future of technology in our country.

            Hello! I am Ali Ganizade and I am 17 years old. 
            I graduated from School number 160. I am a first year at ADA University.
            My degree is Electronics and Electro Engineering. Being motivated 
            by Iron Man films that I watched in my childhood, I started 
            to construct various toys. When I was 16, I helped my school 
            to participate in TechnoFest and then I decided, that I want to improve myself 
            in this field.
