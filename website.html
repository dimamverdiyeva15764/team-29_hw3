      This website is a project carried out by the Team WhoCares. We were able to realize the project after putting painstaking efforts into it for two weeks to find who cares. During this period, all members had to learn markup languages like HTML and CSS individually, and some also learned Java, to acquire a basic understanding of web development. Then, we came together to discuss the project and divide the work among us to build this website from scratch. The purpose of the website is to demonstrate our progress in web development as well as share our previous achievements in the Hour of Code event, where we successfully introduced students to programming. Perhaps, now we finally know who cares - it is each of us from the team who cares not only for one another but also for the world of technology and its future!
